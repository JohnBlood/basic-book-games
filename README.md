# BASIC book games

Back in the day several books were released with full of games written in BASIC. All a player had to do was type the code into their computer to play the game. This repo contains some of those games rewritten for [QB64](https://qb64.org/). To play the games, install QB64, open one of the files and hit F5 to compile. Enjoy.
